Head across the power lines, and take the next 2 lines. You will land on a flower bed, and go around the roof to the left. There is a long power line here, with a piece of bread. Getting on the line can be tricky. You will now meet up with Route 1 and 3. "

You will roll along the power lines and into a long gutter, which takes you along to a sloped roof that drops you onto a flower bed. There is a check point here. Take the next wires to the bread piece.

Zigzag through the crates after you land on the next roof, and turn right. Be careful, there is no railing to keep you from falling. There will be powerlines on the next roof."

Across the power lines that connect the two houses, then roll down the roof onto the flower bed. You are now met up with Routes 1 and 2.

Once all routes meet up on the roof, you have one last piece of bread…the one in the middle of the road before you reach the ocean."

Note: I managed it by going higher up the road that the bread, hugging the edge, then rolling into the middle and grabbing it. I stayed in the middle until a car passed me on the left, then prayed and rolled left as hard as I could. I got hit by a car, but managed to hop into the ocean before i died. "
